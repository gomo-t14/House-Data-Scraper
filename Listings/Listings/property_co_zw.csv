Leading off of this room is a single passage which takes you through to the 3 bedrooms, each with built in cupboards, and to a family bathroom and seperate toilet. The entire living area of the house is finished with original solid wood parquet flooring; bar the kitchen and wet areas which have a cement floor. A small undercover verandah looks out over a deep, disused swimming pool. A borehole has been sited but never drilled, and currently the property owners rely on municipal water which is stored in a tank in the garden. The property is walled and fenced. An added benefit of this property is that the next door vacant land could also be purchased, increasing the overall land to just short of 2.7 acres in total; making it a perfect investment for development.
